The nodes in the outer AST should generally be listed in the following order and grouped as follows:
	Program

	Definition

	Sequence
	Choice

	Reference
	Optional
	OnePlus
	Guard

	Literal
	Set

	Adjoinment
	Extension
	Property

The outer AST nodes can be grouped as follows:
	Misc
		Prog, Def

	Expressions
		Seq, Ch, Ref, Opt, OP,
		Lit, Set

	Statements
		Adj, Ext, Prop, Gu

	(Optional can be a statement or an expression.
	If it contains a node-returning rule, it's a statement;
	otherwise, it's an expression.)
